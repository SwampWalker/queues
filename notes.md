# Learning queue theory

I made this project to learn about queue theory, so here I collect my notes.

I'm following *Fundamentals of Queueing Theory, 5th edition*, by Shortle, Thompson, Gross and Harris.
I'm just going to refer to this as *Fundamentals*, since I don't expect to refer to anything else.

## The M/M/1 queue

Well, we should start simple. This is a poisson process so my first instinct is Poisson distribution, but
the random variable there is the events in a given interval. Instead, we want the thing that the poisson
distribution is built from: the Exponential distribution. That's even what the M means... but I needed to
read it again.

### Data structures? Event based bookkeeping.

*Fundamentals* has a good elaboration of this in section 1.6. The basic idea is to co-recursively generate
a stream of customers. Each customer has an arrival time and a service time.

That defines everything, but the interesting quantities must be derived from that.

The stream can be generated by sampling from the customer arrival distribution and adding that random
variable to the time of arrival of the previous customer. This provides `t_n`, the interarrival time
between customer `(n-1)` and customer `n`. Adding this to the arrival time of the prior customer gives
us the new arrival time `a_n`. *Fundamentals* has the first customer starting
at t=0, which is going to be equivalent due to the memoryless aspect and clearly shouldn't affect the
steady state behavior. The service time of the customer is simply a sample from the service time 
distribution, this provides `s_n`.

From here calculations are easy and iterated. The time that customer `n` starts service, `u_n`, is the time
that customer `(n-1)` leaves the system: `u_n = max(d_(n-1), a_n)`. Where we have implicitly defined the
time that a customer leaves the system as `d_n = u_n + s_n`. Then we have the items of interest: 
`wq_n = u_n - a_n`, the time in the queue and `w_n = wq_n + s_n`.

### The number of people in the system: N(t)

This can be derived from the event stream above. Actually, each "event" above defines three separate events
for customer n:

1. The time that customer n arrives `A_n`,
2. The time that customer n begins service, `U_n`,
3. The time that customer n leaves the system, `D_n`,

The ordered set of all of these `{A_n, U_n, D_n}` times defines the domain of some other time series,

1. The total number of arrivals `A(t)`,
2. The total number of departures `D(t)`,
3. The total number of customers in the system `N(t) = A(t) - D(t)`.

For deriving these time series, it seems that the time of service initiation is unimportant. The number
of people in the queue is clearly the total number of customers in the system minus one or zero, whichever
is larger.

When we sample another customer, either the arrival time is less than the time of the last customer's
departure time or it is greater or it is equal. If it is less, the arrival time is emitted and `A(t)`
is incremented. If it is equal, then `D(t)` is incremented. If it is greater, than the departure time is
emitted incrementing `D(t)` and the process starts over.

In this way, a queue of departure times is kept in memory equal to `N(t_n)`.
